`v0.2.0` · updated 2026-07-15

Reports which Kiteworks folders have an expiry/retention policy configured and which don't.

**[View on the Kiteworks Agent Marketplace →](https://marketplace.kiteworkslabs.com/catalog/folder-expiry-audit)** — live examples, screenshots, and full detail.

## Before you install — the short version

Kiteworks agents are provided **as is**. They are helpful, but they can be wrong. You are responsible for checking what an agent produces before you rely on it, and Kiteworks is not liable for outcomes from using them.

## What's new

Refreshed the safety pre-check.

## Install

Add the marketplace once, then install this agent:

```
/plugin marketplace add rickgoud/kw-claude-marketplace-staging
/plugin install folder-expiry-audit@kiteworks-lite
```

**Claude Desktop:** download `folder-expiry-audit.plugin` (or the identical `folder-expiry-audit.zip` if the uploader rejects `.plugin`) and upload it via **Customize → Personal plugins → Upload plugin**.

## Requires

A remote MCP connector named `Kiteworks` in your Claude organization — your Kiteworks admin provides the tenant-specific link. Without it the workflows have nothing to call.

## Try it

- “Which folders under Client Files have a retention policy set?”
- “Show me folders with no expiry configured”
