# term-sweep — shared keyword/content sweep helper

Read `../folder-scan/SKILL.md` first for scope, walk, and link rules.

## Two match modes

1. **Name/path match** — `search_files` with `parent_folder_id` + `path_contains: "<term>"`. Confirmed live: this is recursive (finds matches in subfolders, not just the given folder) and reliable. This is the default, always-on match mode — cheap, one call, no per-file work.

2. **Content match — real extraction, not server-side search.** `content_contains` is confirmed non-functional (tested deliberately across a 20-minute-old plain-text file with the exact term in it, multiple real PDFs from 2014 searched for both an ultra-common word and a domain word, and both the `search`/`search_files` tools — zero results every time; not an indexing-latency issue). Do not call `content_contains` at all. Instead, for genuine content-based matching, read `../content-extract/SKILL.md` and use it: for each candidate file (bounded per that skill's cap), extract its real text and check for the term(s) client-side yourself. This actually works, but it's real per-file work (a download and parse for binary formats), so treat it as an **opt-in "deep scan"**, not part of the default sweep — ask the user before running it, tell them roughly how many files are in scope, and respect `content-extract`'s cap and disclosure rules.

## Term lists

Collect the term list from the user (e.g. sensitive-content-scanner: "confidential", "SSN", "ITAR", client names; contract-radar: "agreement", "MSA", "SOW", "NDA"). Never invent a default list without asking — sensitivity/contract vocabulary is organization-specific.

## Built-in pattern presets (2026-07-13) — a third match mode, alongside name/path and custom-term content matching

Asking the user to type "SSN" as a term only catches a file that spells out the word "SSN" — it does nothing for a file that contains an actual SSN-*shaped* number. A real sensitive-content scanner should recognize common PII/secret *shapes*, not just the words people use to describe them.

Whenever a content deep-scan runs, also run `scripts/pii_patterns.py <extracted-text-file>` against the same extracted text. It checks five categories with real checksum/shape validation (not naive digit-counting regex): `ssn_shaped`, `bsn_shaped` (Dutch elfproef/11-test), `credit_card_luhn_valid` (Luhn), `iban_checksum_valid` (mod-97), `aws_access_key` (AKIA prefix). Each category reports two counts: `valid` (checksum/shape-valid matches) and `context_confirmed` (the subset also near a relevant keyword within 60 characters, e.g. "SSN", "IBAN", "social security" — a second, independent signal on top of checksum validity, since checksums alone still have a non-trivial chance-pass rate). Report both counts per category, including zero-hit categories — a clean result is real information, not noise to omit. Never print the matched values themselves, only categories and counts.

Tell the user this runs by default whenever the deep scan runs, and let them turn it off if they only want their own term list.

## Custom regex mode (2026-07-13) — a fourth match mode, for patterns the built-in presets don't cover

The five built-in categories are deliberately narrow and checksum-validated. For anything else with a defined shape — an internal employee ID like `EMP-\d{6}`, a project code, a partner-specific account number — the user can supply their own regex(es) and have them evaluated the same deterministic way, rather than the agent trying to eyeball extracted text for the pattern itself (which would mean reading raw content into its own reasoning, defeating the point of keeping it out of the conversation).

To use it: write the user's pattern(s) to a scratch JSON file as an array of `{"label": "...", "regex": "...", "context_keywords": [...]}` objects (`context_keywords` optional), then run `scripts/pii_patterns.py <extracted-text-file> <custom-patterns.json>`. The result gains a `"custom"` key: `{label: {"valid": N, "context_confirmed": N, "error": null|"..."}}`.

Safety properties, all live-verified:
- **A bad regex never crashes the run** — a `re.compile` failure is caught and reported as `"error": "invalid regex: ..."` for that pattern only, with `valid`/`context_confirmed` at 0.
- **A pathological regex can't hang the scan** — each pattern gets a 3-second wall-clock guard (`SIGALRM`-based); a catastrophically-backtracking pattern (e.g. `(a+)+$` against a long run of the wrong character) times out with a clear `"error"` instead of hanging.
- **Input is length-capped** (2,000,000 characters) before evaluation, with a `"note"` flag if truncation happened.
- Same privacy rule as everything else here: never print the matched value, only the count.

Ask the user for their regex and an optional label/context keywords the same way you'd ask for a term list — don't invent one.

## Running the scripts

Both scripts live in `scripts/` alongside this file and are invoked via `Bash` (`Read`/`Bash`/`Skill` tools, per `content-extract`'s Cowork/Claude Code path) against a scratch text file containing the extracted content — never paste extracted content into the conversation to run these checks manually.
