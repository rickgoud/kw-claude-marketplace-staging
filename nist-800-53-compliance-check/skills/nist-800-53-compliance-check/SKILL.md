  Use when the user asks to check Kiteworks content against NIST SP 800-53 --
  trigger phrases include `NIST SP 800-53` `SP 800-53` `RMF` `FISMA` `ATO` `SSP narrative`. Scans and, on confirmation,
  writes a CSV + txt/pdf report. Single-phase: no separate "apply" step
  to ask for. Fit tier: Light -- see below for what this can and can't
  actually check.

Delegate to the `nist-800-53-compliance-check` subagent on surfaces that support it (Claude Code, Cowork). If it reports no tools or fabricates results without tool calls, discard and check the `Kiteworks` connector. On other surfaces, follow this skill directly.

# NIST SP 800-53 Compliance Check -- fit tier: Light

Read `../compliance-mapping/SKILL.md` first for the shared mechanism (signals A/B/C/D, report shape, honesty framing) -- this skill only supplies framework-specific content, never its own scanning logic.

## What NIST SP 800-53 actually is

NIST's federal security and privacy controls catalog (Rev 5) underlying FISMA, RMF, and FedRAMP baselines across 20 control families.

## Signals this agent runs

Signals: **A, B**. Signal A's default term list for this framework: "CUI", "federal information", "controlled unclassified" (plus the built-in PII/secret presets, plus anything the user adds).

## Control citations

Drawn directly from NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (September 2020, with errata), not the third-party GRC skill library. Rev 5 has 1,196 controls and enhancements across 20 families.

- **Signal A** (sensitive-content exposure): AC-3 (Access Enforcement) and MP-6 (Media Sanitization) are the closest family matches for CUI/PII-shaped content found at rest.
- **Signal B** (external sharing): AC-4 (Information Flow Enforcement) and SC-8 (Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity) directly govern data leaving an authorized boundary.

## What this doesn't check

System categorisation, control tailoring, and SSP narrative authorship concern a federal system's whole control implementation, not one folder -- this only flags CUI/PII-shaped content and its sharing exposure, touching the Media Protection and Access Control families at the edges.

## Recommended next steps

- Complete or update the System Security Plan (SSP) reflecting actual control implementation across all 20 families, not just AC/MP/SC.
- Confirm continuous monitoring is current per the applicable Risk Management Framework (RMF) step.

Adapted from the NIST SP 800-53 skill in the Claude Skills for Governance, Risk & Compliance library (`Sushegaad/Claude-Skills-Governance-Risk-and-Compliance`) -- https://sushegaad.github.io/Claude-Skills-Governance-Risk-and-Compliance/ -- which offers much deeper advisory capability (policy/document drafting, licensing walkthroughs, breach-notification procedures) than a content-governance scan can ever provide.
