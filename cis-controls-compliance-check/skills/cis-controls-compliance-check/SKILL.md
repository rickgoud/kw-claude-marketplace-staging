  Use when the user asks to check Kiteworks content against CIS Controls v8 --
  trigger phrases include `CIS Controls` `CIS Top 18` `CIS v8` `Implementation Group`. Scans and, on confirmation,
  writes a CSV + txt/pdf report. Single-phase: no separate "apply" step
  to ask for. Fit tier: Light -- see below for what this can and can't
  actually check.

Delegate to the `cis-controls-compliance-check` subagent on surfaces that support it (Claude Code, Cowork). If it reports no tools or fabricates results without tool calls, discard and check the `Kiteworks` connector. On other surfaces, follow this skill directly.

# CIS Controls v8 Compliance Check -- fit tier: Light

Read `../compliance-mapping/SKILL.md` first for the shared mechanism (signals A/B/C/D, report shape, honesty framing) -- this skill only supplies framework-specific content, never its own scanning logic.

## What CIS Controls v8 actually is

The Center for Internet Security's 18 controls and 153 safeguards for essential cyber hygiene, scoped by Implementation Group (IG1-IG3).

## Signals this agent runs

Signals: **A, B**.

## Control citations

Drawn directly from CIS Controls v8 (Center for Internet Security), not the third-party GRC skill library.

- **Signal A** (sensitive-content exposure): Safeguard 3.1 (establish and maintain a data management process addressing sensitivity, ownership, handling, retention, and disposal) and Safeguard 3.3 (establish and maintain a data access control list) govern how sensitive content should be classified and gated.
- **Signal B** (external sharing): Safeguard 3.11 (encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest) is the direct match for a file leaving the organization's control.

## What this doesn't check

Asset inventory, vulnerability management, and most of the 18 controls concern infrastructure and endpoint management this scan cannot see -- this speaks only to Control 3 (Data Protection)'s sharing/exposure angle.

## Recommended next steps

- Implement the full set of Control 3 safeguards appropriate to your Implementation Group (IG1-IG3), not just the three cited here.
- Extend the security program to the other 17 CIS Controls, which this scan has no visibility into at all.

Adapted from the CIS Controls v8 skill in the Claude Skills for Governance, Risk & Compliance library (`Sushegaad/Claude-Skills-Governance-Risk-and-Compliance`) -- https://sushegaad.github.io/Claude-Skills-Governance-Risk-and-Compliance/ -- which offers much deeper advisory capability (policy/document drafting, licensing walkthroughs, breach-notification procedures) than a content-governance scan can ever provide.
