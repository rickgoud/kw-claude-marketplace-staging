# Intake Form Builder

`v0.1.0` · updated 2026-07-13

Builds a Kiteworks intake or request form from a short description of what you need to collect.

**[View on the Kiteworks Agent Marketplace →](https://marketplace.kiteworkslabs.com/catalog/intake-form-builder)** — live examples, screenshots, and full detail.

## Before you install — the short version

Kiteworks agents are provided **as is**. They are helpful, but they can be wrong. You are responsible for checking what an agent produces before you rely on it, and Kiteworks is not liable for outcomes from using them.

## What's new

Turns a short plain-language description into a ready-to-use Kiteworks intake/request form — stand up a collection workflow without hand-building fields.

## Install

Add the marketplace once, then install this agent:

```
/plugin marketplace add rickgoud/kw-claude-marketplace-staging
/plugin install intake-form-builder@kiteworks-lite
```

**Claude Desktop:** download `intake-form-builder.plugin` (or the identical `intake-form-builder.zip` if the uploader rejects `.plugin`) and upload it via **Customize → Personal plugins → Upload plugin**.

## Requires

A remote MCP connector named `Kiteworks` in your Claude organization — your Kiteworks admin provides the tenant-specific link. Without it the workflows have nothing to call.

## Try it

- “Build an intake form to collect vendor onboarding documents”
- “Add a dropdown for region and make the W-9 required”
