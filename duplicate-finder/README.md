# Duplicate Finder

`v0.5.1` · updated 2026-07-15

Finds duplicate files in a Kiteworks folder and, once you approve, moves the extra copies to a review folder so you can reclaim space.

**[View on the Kiteworks Agent Marketplace →](https://marketplace.kiteworkslabs.com/catalog/duplicate-finder)** — live examples, screenshots, and full detail.

## What's new

Refreshed the branded report and the safety pre-check.

## Install

Add the marketplace once, then install this agent:

```
/plugin marketplace add rickgoud/kw-claude-marketplace-staging
/plugin install duplicate-finder@kiteworks-lite
```

**Claude Desktop:** download `duplicate-finder.plugin` (or the identical `duplicate-finder.zip` if the uploader rejects `.plugin`) and upload it via **Customize → Personal plugins → Upload plugin**.

## Requires

A remote MCP connector named `Kiteworks` in your Claude organization — your Kiteworks admin provides the tenant-specific link. Without it the workflows have nothing to call.

## Try it

- “Find duplicate files in the Marketing Assets folder”
- “Move the duplicate copies to a review folder for me to check”
